# book-content

This project built on top of `nextjs,mdx,tailwind`. For adding a book you need to follow this pattern

```
---
title: "Book title"
publishedAt: "Date when you are adding this"
img: "/books/book image url"
author: "Book author"
desc: "Book description"
---

```
**Note:** You also need to upload book cover inside public directory
