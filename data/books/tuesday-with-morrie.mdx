desc: "Maybe it was a grandparent, or a teacher, or a colleague. Someone
  older, patient and wise, who understood you when you were young and
  searching, helped you see the world as a more profound place, gave you
  sound advice to help you make your way through it."
---

1. Accept the past as past, without denying it or discarded it
2. Dont assume its too late to get involved
3. Dying is only one thing to be sad over. Living unhappily is something else
4. Life is series of pulls back and forth. You want to do one thing, but you are bound to do something else. You take certain things for granted, even when you know you should never take anything for granted
5. Money is not the most important thing. You need to be fully human
6. If you really want it, then you will make your dream happen
7. The most important thing in life to learn how to give out love, and let it come in
8. Why are we embarrassed by the silence?what comfort do we find in the noise
9. I give myself a good cry if I need it. But then i concentrate on all good things still in my life
10. How useful it would be to put a daily limit on self pity
11. Its only horrible if you see it that way
12. Sometimes you cannot believe what you see, you have to believe what you feel
13. Learn to detach. Dont clings to things, because every thing is Impermanent
14. Throwing yourself into emotion, by allowing yourself to dive in, all the way, over your head even, you experience them fully snd completely. You know what pain is. You know what love is. You know what grief is. And only then you can say, all right i have experienced that emotion. I recognize that emotion. Now i need to detach from that emotion for a moment
15. This is fear. Step away from it. Step away
16. All right it's just fear, i dont have to let it control me. I see it for what it is
17. All right that was my moment with loneliness. I am not afraid of feeling lonely, but now i am going to put that loneliness aside and know that there are other emotions in the world, and I am going to experience them as well
18. This is how you start to get respect, by offering something that you have
19. You dont need to have a bug talent. There are lonely people in hospitals and shelterd who only want companionship
20. Devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning
21. Status will get you nowhere. Only an open heart will allow you to float equally between everyone
22. I believe in being fully present
23. People haven't found meaning in their lives, so they are running all time looking for it. They think the next car, house job. Then they find those things are empty, too and they keep running
24. They dont know what they want in the partner. They dont knoe who they are themselves so how can they know who they are marrying
25. Loved one is so important. You realize that especially when you are in time like I am, when you are not doing so well. Friends are great but friends are not going to be here on nigh when you are coughing and can't sleep and someone has to sit up all night with you, comfort you, try to be helpful
26. Work as a team
27. If you don't respect another person, you are gonna have a lot of trouble
28. If you don't know how to compromise you are gonna have a lot of trouble
29. If you can't talk openly about what goes in between you, if you dont have common set of values in life, you are gonna have a lot of trouble
30. People are mean only when they are threatened
31. I know it hearts when you cant be with someone you love. But you need to be at peace with his desires
32. Love is when you are as concerned about someone else's situation as you are about your own
33. There is no such thing as too late. He was changing until the day he said goodbye
