- I don’t want to be a slave to my thoughts. I want the opposite.

- You can be the best writer and teacher in the world, but if no one knows about it, you can’t make an impact.
- Work on it today. Not tomorrow.
- What thing(s) should I eliminate to make my life so simple that it’s easy to focus
- Life is already hard enough. Don’t make it harder.

- To improve your focus, boost your serotonin activity. Research shows that exercise can do that. But something else, that’s equally effective, and a lot easier is a simple mind-exercise. All you need to do is remember positive events that happened in the past

- When it comes to relationships, quality matters more than quantity. Though it’s easy to pick on people who are influenced by social media

- We only love someone until they, for example, change their views or gain a few pounds. Or we only invite friends to our birthdays as long as they go out with you and drink beer

- You can easily improve your energy by exercising more and eating well.

- In order to really find happiness, you need to continue looking for opportunities that you believe are meaningful, in which you will be able to learn new things, to succeed, and be given more and more responsibility to shoulder

- Also, income is directly related to your learning development. The more you learn, the more you earn

- Without action, knowledge is useless.

- My experience is that when you make time for the people that matter to you, the relationships improve. And if they do not, the relationship was probably not meant to be. We simply have to move on.

- The real lesson here is that we always must focus on what we can control

- When you procrastinate, you might feel better on the short-term, but you will suffer in the long-term

- Self-regulation, self-control, willpower, are all things that we overestimate

- Sure, everybody fears to step outside of their comfort zone — that’s why we call them comfort zones.

- Willpower Doesn’t Work. Systems Do.

- Freedom is your enemy. The fact is that, if you want to get things done, you need rules

- No matter what kind of worry you have, the response in your body is always the same: It increases your cortisol levels.

- And an increased cortisol level is something you definitely do not want. Cortisol compromises your immune system. As a result, you will become more susceptible to disease.

- Win your inner battle

- What’s the outcome of checking?

- Checking is a habit that you can never fully eliminate. I still follow the NBA because I like it. Pick only 1 or 2 “checking” vices you actually like. Eliminate the rest. You’re not missing anything anyway.

- Escaping problems gives you some stamina to face your shitty life again.

- If you keep saying yes, you’re living someone else’s life.

- Think about it. Deep down, we all know that it’s true. We’re not even in control of our own time. Want to be in full control of your life? Say no to a million things and yes to a few things that matter.

- Everything you do after getting out of bed is a win.

- Your life stops when learning stops.

- Invest in yourself. Learn something. Read books. Get courses. Watch videos. Do it from home or go places. It doesn’t matter. Just learn new things. You’ll be more productive and more excited about life.

- when it comes to productivity, the first rule is: Have rules.

- To be everywhere is to be nowhere.

- Too much of anything is a bad thing. Even good things.

- So why do you consume so much internet? I asked myself that question 2 years ago. I had no answer.

- It seems like we want to skip the actual work and only focus on the outcome.

- Life is too short to do work you don’t enjoy.

- No matter how many productivity hacks you try, you won’t produce more if you’re not passionate about what you do

- We all know that time is finite, so why not behave accordingly? If you know that you have limited time on this planet, why waste it?

- I’m a believer of ‘do what you’re passionate about’, but I’m also a believer of ‘do what you’re good at.

- And procrastination can be a sign that you’re doing something that’s not meaningful. Don’t let procrastination become a habit. After all, the worst procrastination is putting off your dreams and goals. If you’re waiting for the right time, Benjamin Franklin says: “You may delay, but time will not.” If you don’t listen to me, listen to him.

- Michel de Montaigne, the 16th-century philosopher, said it best: “My life has been full of terrible misfortunes most of which never happened.”

- It’s about knowing what you want, and also knowing how you can get it

- There is never a time when new distraction will not show up.

- We falsely believe that we can manage time. But time can’t be managed. The only thing you control is your attention

- Focus determines the quality of your life. No focus means no control of your attention. And no control means frustration. We all know what frustration leads to. Start managing your attention. Not your time.

- It means that I refuse to be a slave to my phone. I control my phone.

- The one that never starts. You want to achieve something, but you immediately start doubting yourself. You think: “I don’t think I can do it.” So you never start.

- The one that starts but has too high standards. You set a goal. You work hard (maybe too hard). But you’ve set your goals so high, that you’re always failing yourself.

- Achieving goals is not the only thing in life. It’s more about HOW we reach our goals and aspirations.

- But if you want to make things happen in your life, you have to care. And what you want is to find a middle ground where your perfectionistic tendencies drive you, but you have the calm of a slacker, and you combine that with learned resourcefulness.

- Dopamine is one of the body’s happy chemicals; it controls the “pleasure” systems of the brain and makes you feel joy. This joyous feeling is addictive and makes us seek out behaviors that stimulate dopamine.

- While dopamine may cause a rush, it also exhausts us. That is why you still feel tired at the end of the day while you have not been productive. This is a harmful process, and we need to stop this pattern.

- Do something that’s worth your time.

- Be conscious about your time. And spend so it improves the quality of your life.

- Tools, apps, or hacks, don’t work if you lack the right mindset because productivity is a way of living.

- I think that output and happiness go hand in hand. To me, doing nothing equals misery.

- Stop consuming, start creating.

- People who never take time off to do nothing are short-term focused. “I want to reach my goals! NOW

- People often say that motivation doesn’t last. Well, neither does bathing — that’s why we recommend it daily

- But worrying is a waste of time and energy.

- When things goes wrong we become our own worst enemy because we focus on the things that we can't control

- Life’s too short to be a wimp

- And you probably also know that it’s not easy. So why do you make things even harder for yourself by doing shit that makes you very uncomfortable?

- But we also need growth. So whatever you do, don’t stay in your comfort zone for too long. Try to keep moving forward every day: Even if it’s just a tiny step. No magic. Just effort

- You will never become a respectable leader without putting in the work. Your life will never change unless you take action.

- Everything that’s worth it is hard.

- Fear begets fear. When you’re afraid that you won’t be able to grow, what will happen? Exactly, you won’t grow!

- We always must focus on what we can control.

- You see, things take time. And when you combine patience with compounding, you achieve the biggest results.

- You don’t build a strong body in a day, month, or even a year. It takes years of consistent effort. Shortcuts don’t exist, no matter how ‘smart’ you work.

- If you want to see the impact of compounding in your own life, it requires you to focus on one thing at a time (for every aspect of your life) and always look at the bigger picture. It comes down to this: You’ll get there if you put in the work. Who cares if it’s tomorrow or 20 years? It will happen. That’s all that matters.
